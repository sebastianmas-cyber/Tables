# **App Name**: Tables

## Core Features:

- CO2 Table Generation: Generate a CO2 tolerance table based on user-inputted personal best breath-hold time, creating a table that decreases recovery time and adapts the user to higher carbon dioxide levels.
- O2 Table Generation: Generate an O2 tolerance table based on user-inputted personal best breath-hold time, creating a table that increases hold time and adapts the user to lower oxygen levels.
- Timer Functionality: Implement a timer to guide users through each phase of the training tables (prep, hold, recovery) with audio cues.
- Session Control: Provide start and stop session buttons for users to control their training, including an alert modal and function to handle the safety and custom alerts
- UI Enhancements: Implement responsive UI components of the original page, to include all safety guidelines. Show/hide relevant parts of the page at appropriate times during the user experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: very light blue, complementing the existing Tailwind CSS styles to maintain visual consistency and user familiarity.
- Background color: dark blue, a desaturated variant of the primary to enhance the dark scheme and minimize eye strain.
- Accent color: green, used sparingly to draw attention to interactive elements and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, maintaining consistency with the current application, to convey modernity and readability.
- Use simple, geometric icons for a modern feel.
- Subtle transitions on timer updates, and a countdown animation on last three seconds before timer rings.
